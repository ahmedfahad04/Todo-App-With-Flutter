# Todo-App-With-Flutter
This is the very first complete project on Flutter. Though almost whole codebase is taken from a youtube video but my prime motive was how the ui and backend interact with each other.

## What I have Learnt
  * How ListView and ListTile works dynamically.
  * How can we conduct Search over the List Items.
  * How to use TextEditingController with TextField/TextFormField
  * How to use For loop within the widget Parameters.
  * How to use showModalBottomSheet.
  * Most Importantly I learnt How to *modularize* the code base.
